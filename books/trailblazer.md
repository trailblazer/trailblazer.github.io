  <h1>Trailblazer</h1>
  <h2 class="subheader">A New Architecture For Rails</h2>

    <p>Written by the creator of Trailblazer, this book gives you <b>300 pages full of wisdom about Trailblazer</b> and its gems, such as Reform, Cells and Roar.</p>

    <p>The book comes with a <a href="https://github.com/apotonick/gemgem-trbrb">sample app repository</a> to conveniently browse through changes per chapter.</p>

    <p> In the book, <b>we build a realistic Rails application with Trailblazer</b> that discusses convoluted requirements such as dynamic forms, polymorphic rendering and processing for signed-in users, file uploads, pagination, a JSON document API sitting on top of that, and many more problems you run into when building web applications.</p>

    <h3>
    Here's an overview of the 13 chapters</h3>

    <p>In chapter 2, <b>The Trailblazer Architectural Style</b>, we discuss implementation concepts, file structuring and how Trailblazer solves problems from conventional MVC frameworks such as Rails.</p>

    <p>The next chapter <b>Operations and Forms</b> will introduce you how Trailblazer introduces a new abstraction layer <em>Operation</em> that embraces the business logic. We learn how to benefit from the operation's internal form object, so that you can start applying this pattern to your existing software.</p>

    <p>After learning the basics, we dive into <b>Cells</b> and explore how to use view components in Trailblazer to build a grid-based homepage. The following <b>Nested Forms</b> chapter goes into more details of operations and how they interact with <b>Reform</b>. To round this up, the learnt concepts about view models and forms are combined in the <b>Composed Views</b> chapter.</p>

    <p>We then discuss <b>Callbacks</b> and post-processing logic in operations, and how that is a fundamental different approach to the Rails way of doing it.</p>

    <p>Chapter 9 and 10 show you how <b>Authentication</b> works in a Trailblazer application, and how <b>Authorization and Polymorphism</b> help to maintain polymorphic operations, forms and views for different user roles.</p>

    <p>Having covered all aspects of a real web software, the last two chapters are all about document APIs with Roar. <b>Hypermedia APIs: Rendering</b> discusses the usage of representers from operations and how to serialize JSON documents. But that's only half of the work! <b>Hypermedia APIs: Deserialization</b> will teach you how to use representers for parsing incoming documents and validate them using the operation's form.</p>
