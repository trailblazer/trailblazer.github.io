# Representable

Representable maps objects to documents (rendering) and documents to objects (parsing) using _representers_. Representers define the document structure and the transformation to/from objects.

Representers can define deeply nested object graphs....

It is very popular amongst REST API developers as it tackles both sides of exposing APIs: rendering documents and deserializing incoming documents to object graphs using a very generic approach.

But it's also very helpful as a generic data transformer. ...


In case you're looking towards implementing a REST API, check out [Roar](/gems/roar) first, which adds hypermedia semantics, media formats and more to Representable
