              <p>Greetings, my Trailblazer friends!</p>

<p>Winter is coming down here in Australia and it’s getting a bit colder - the perfect excuse for us to work more on the Trailblazer project.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened during the past couple of weeks. We had some exciting new releases and discussed a bunch of interesting opportunities for the project and its community.</p>

<h2 id="our-gitter-channel" data-magellan-target="our-gitter-channel">Our Gitter Channel</h2>

<p>It is a great thing for OSS authors to see a community evolve around projects. Our Gitter channel is growing every day and seems to be a great place for support, even if it’s just “a little thing” you’re stuck with. Come <a href="https://gitter.im/trailblazer/chat">join the community today</a> - we love helping each other and often, there’s intense debates about software architecture, programming languages or wine tastings going on. Luckily, you can turn off notifications. ;)</p>

<h2 id="cells-41-released" data-magellan-target="cells-41-released">Cells 4.1 Released</h2>

<p>We’re super excited to announce the release of Cells 4.1. This version cleans up the core even more and paves the way for a super fast Cells 5.0 that we’re planning. It also got rid of <em>any Rails dependencies</em>, so Cells 4.1 won’t import or need anything of Rails and works perfectly fine in Sinatra or Hanami.</p>

<p>I’ve written a <a href="http://nicksda.apotomo.de/2016/05/cells-4-1-block-support-better-collections-external-layouts/">blog post about Cells 4.1</a> and all the features, but here’s a few canapés for you.</p>

<h2 id="layouts" data-magellan-target="layouts">Layouts</h2>

<p>My absolute favorite addition is that every cell can now have an external layout cell. While the actual <em>content cell</em> is responsible to represent the fragment, the <em>layout cell</em> will present the outer container. This is very similar to how Rails or other frameworks handle layouts around content.</p>

<p>Instead of configuring the content cell on the class level, you can inject the layout cell. This allows a more flexible way of handling layouts, and can easily be abstracted in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ApplicationController</code>.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">cell</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:comment</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">comment</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">layout: </span><span class="no">LayoutCell</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">LayoutCell</code> is a simplistic cell class and <code class="highlighter-rouge">yield</code>s the content in its view.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>!!!
%html
  %head
    %title= "Gemgem"
    = stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all'
  %body
    = yield
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>What’s pretty awesome about this: It now, finally, allows to complete ditch ActionView and use Cells for everything. Great, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the layout comes the <em>context object</em> in Cells 4.1. We now maintain a special object that is automatically being passed from cell to cell and allows to propagate “global” objects such as the current user or helper objects via a clean, explicit mechanism.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">cell</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:comment</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">comment</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">layout: </span><span class="no">LayoutCell</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">context: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">user: </span><span class="n">current_user</span> <span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Both content and layout will have access to the user via <code class="highlighter-rouge">context[:user]</code> now. This also works “downwards” when nesting cells into cells.</p>

<h2 id="trailblazercell" data-magellan-target="trailblazercell">Trailblazer::Cell</h2>

<p>As a logical conclusion, we’ve released the <a href="https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-cells">trailblazer-cells</a> which helps you using the Trailblazer file structure and optimized semantics in your project. It really is a very thin “reconfiguration” of the Cells gem, only.</p>

<p>Cell classes now have a very constrained naming scheme which greatly improves productivity as you don’t have to think about cell names anymore.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Comment::Cell</span>
  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Show</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Trailblazer</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Cell</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Ideally, cell classes can be empty as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">show</code> method is automatically added. In Trailblazer cells, views are resolved differently. In this class, the looked up view will be expected in <code class="highlighter-rouge">app/concepts/comment/view/show.haml</code>. Note that the cell’s class name dictates the view name, and not the state.</p>

<p>The new behavior introduces very strong conventions and many Trailblazer users love it already. You should try it out if you’re using Cells.</p>

<h2 id="gemgem-hanami" data-magellan-target="gemgem-hanami">Gemgem-Hanami</h2>

<p>In my spare free time, I started working on an example application that shows how <a href="http://hanamirb.org">Hanami</a> and Trailblazer work together. It is so much fun <a href="https://github.com/apotonick/gemgem-hanami">working on this project</a> and the two fit together just great.</p>

<p>I use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trailblazer::Cell</code> for the views and let operations handle the business logic in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hanami::Action</code>s - fantastic stuff!</p>

<p>The project also plays with some advanced features such as Postgres’ <code class="highlighter-rouge">JSONB</code> columns for complex data types to be used within the operation and contract. We will surely write about this once it’s a bit more, well, let’s say <em>readable</em>.</p>

<p>Also, a new gem trailblazer-hanami will soon be pushed. It won’t be more than a few dozens lines of code, but simplifies the workflow of using Trailblazer in Hanami.</p>

<h2 id="blog-posts" data-magellan-target="blog-posts">Blog Posts</h2>

<p>In the past months I’ve started writing some articles for Sitepoint. <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-cells-a-better-view-layer-for-rails/">The first article</a> introduces Cells, <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/cells-a-deeper-look-into-dependency-injection-and-testing/">the second speaks</a> about advanced features such as dependency injections or testing in Cells.</p>

<p>Especially the first post has been the most popular Ruby post for many days and generated a lot of comments around Cells - it’s worth a read!</p>

<h2 id="new-20-minutes-guide" data-magellan-target="new-20-minutes-guide">New 20-Minutes Guide</h2>

<p>After around two years of trailblazing I finally managed to write up a very brief guide what is Trailblazer and how does it work. Check out the <a href="/guides/trailblazer-in-20-minutes.html">Trailblazer In 20 Minutes</a> article, it actually takes only 12 minutes.</p>

<p>We’re confident that this short guide will help many more people to get onboard and understand Trailblazer and its architecture within a few minutes, without having to read an entire book.</p>

<h2 id="trailblazer-pro" data-magellan-target="trailblazer-pro">Trailblazer Pro</h2>

<p>We are currently discussing how to “professionalize” Trailblazer and support. We’re thinking about offering a monthly <em>Trailblazer Pro</em> plan soon, which will give clients access to a private chat channel and ticket system for instant response support, and a new premium documentation area with cookbook recipes (for Trailblazer, not spaghetti bolognese), curated content and screencasts.</p>

<p>We are very interested in hearing your opinions about that and what you would like to see happening in Trailblazer, such as an LTS version, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">trailblazer-enterprise</code> project with higher-level building blocks, and so on. Please <a href="https://gitter.im/trailblazer/chat">let us know what you think</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-tapas" data-magellan-target="ruby-tapas">Ruby Tapas</h2>

<p>While we’re at it: since living off Open Source is extremely hard and involves a lot of work, I’d like to mention my friend Avdi Grimm, an absolute Ruby legend and inspiration for the community with his books, talks, blog posts and screencasts for years.</p>

<p>He is kindly asking to <a href="https://twitter.com/avdi/status/734743580934344704">help him not go broke</a> by subscribing to his incredibly cool Ruby Tapas screencast. If you’re interested in learning about programming from him, <a href="http://www.rubytapas.com/">join the Tapas gourmet’s circle</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rails-criticism-everywhere" data-magellan-target="rails-criticism-everywhere">Rails-Criticism Everywhere</h2>

<p>Waves of controversy were being generated by my friend Piotr Solnica’s blog post <a href="http://solnic.eu/2016/05/22/my-time-with-rails-is-up.html">My Time With Rails Is Up</a>. He explains why it is incredibly hard for alternative Ruby library authors like us to work in the Rails environment and criticises workflows in and around Rails core. A justified standpoint and a really good post that every Ruby developer should read.</p>

<p>A fantastic follow-up post was then published by our best Fabio Akita. In his post <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2016/05/23/rails-has-won-the-elephant-in-the-room">Rails Has Won: The Elephant In The Room</a> he seconds many of Piotr’s statements but also explains why we can’t get around Rails at the moment.</p>

<p>You can spend several hours going through all the comments on the posts, Reddit, Twitter, and so on.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to stay out the conversation wherever possible, though, since my opinion about the problems with Rails’ lack of innovation are well known. I think we’re doing a good job in providing an alternative architecture with Trailblazer, and thanks goes out to the two bloggers and friends for mentioning us in both articles!</p>

<h2 id="conferences" data-magellan-target="conferences">Conferences</h2>

<p>A bunch of hand-selected conference talks are coming up this (northern-hemisphere) summer! I will be talking about Trailblazer, the problems with Rails and why sticking to 10-years old APIs is the opposition of stability.</p>

<p>Come and join us if you can!</p>
